# linux-command-terminal
Welcome to the Linux Command Terminal project! This project is a basic terminal (or shell) that lets you type and run simple Linux commands, just like you would in a real terminal on your computer. It's a great way to learn how terminals work behind the scenes!


#About This Project
This project creates a small version of a Linux terminal created using data structures where you can type commands, see results, and even handle files and directories. Itâ€™s designed to help beginners understand how terminals work by building a simple version themselves.

#Features
Run basic Linux commands.
Change directories, list files, and view file contents.
Handle special commands like cd, exit, and pwd.
